                <p class = text> 
                    The Bible is one of the most powerful and influential pieces of literature on the planet. 
                    Its ability to stay relevant throughout the ages and create joy in others makes it the perfect book to make into an NFT. 
                    The team at Scriptures NFT understands the importance of this book and is working hard to give this project the respect it deserves. 
                    We detest the commodification of holy scripture and for that reason will donate all profits made from this project to non-profit 
                    organizations chosen by the ScripturesNFT community!

                <p class = text> 
                    Scriptures NFT was co-founded by a group of like-minded, Crypto-Christians. 
                    As we watched Defi revolutionize the Finance industry we saw an opportunity to leverage Blockchain technology and finally bring Christianity into the 21st Century. 
                    ScripturesNFT is much more than your average jpeg/pfp NFT project. We want to decentralize the Church by creating a community of Christians who are willing to help and support one another while spreading the Word of God. 
                    Through the combination of holy scripture and the blockchain, we no longer need to rely on a centralized organization like the Church. 
                    Each of us has the power to find God through our own interpretation of the holy scriptures and unlike a physical church, we can bring Christians together on a global scale. 
                    Whether youâ€™ve been a Christian your entire life or just started your spiritual journey, we welcome all into the ScripturesNFT community!
